NAME
    File::Find::Upwards - Look for a file in the current directory and
    upwards

VERSION
    version 1.100860

SYNOPSIS
        use File::Find::Upwards qw(file_find_upwards);

        my $filename = file_find_upwards('myconfig.yaml');
        if ($filename) { rand() }

DESCRIPTION
    Provides functions that can find a file in the current or a parent
    directory.

FUNCTIONS
  file_find_upwards
    Takes a filename and looks for the file in the current directory. If
    there is no such file, it traverses up the directory hierarchy until it
    finds the file or until it reaches the topmost directory. If the file is
    found, the full path to the file is returned. If the file is not found,
    undef is returned.

    The result is memoized, so repeated calls to the function with the same
    filename will return the result of the first call for that filename.

    This function is exported automatically.

  find_containing_dir_upwards
    Like "file_find_upwards()", but reports the directory that contains the
    file. A "Path::Class::Dir" object is returned.

    This function is exported automatically.
