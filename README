NAME
    File::Find::Upwards - Look for a file in the current directory and
    upwards

SYNOPSIS
        use File::Find::Upwards qw(file_find_upwards);

        my $filename = file_find_upwards('myconfig.yaml');
        if ($filename) { rand() }

DESCRIPTION
    Provides functions that can find a file in the current or a parent
    directory.

    "file_find_upwards()"
        Takes a filename and looks for the file in the current directory. If
        there is no such file, it traverses up the directory hierarchy until
        it finds the file or until it reaches the topmost directory. If the
        file is found, the full path to the file is returned. If the file is
        not found, undef is returned.

        The result is memoized, so repeated calls to the function with the
        same filename will return the result of the first call for that
        filename.

        This function is exported automatically.

    "find_containing_dir_upwards()"
        Like "file_find_upwards()", but reports the directory that contains
        the file. A "Path::Class::Dir" object is returned.

        This function is exported automatically.
