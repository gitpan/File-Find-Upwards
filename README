NAME
    File::Find::Upwards - Look for a file in the current directory and
    upwards

VERSION
    version 1.102030

SYNOPSIS
        use File::Find::Upwards qw(file_find_upwards);

        my $filename = file_find_upwards('myconfig.yaml');
        if ($filename) { rand() }

DESCRIPTION
    Provides functions that can find a file in the current or a parent
    directory.

FUNCTIONS
  file_find_upwards
    Takes a list of filenames and looks for these file in the current
    directory. If there is no such file, it traverses up the directory
    hierarchy until it finds at least one of those files or until it reaches
    the topmost directory. If one of these files is found, the full path to
    the file is returned. The filenames are checked in the order they are
    given, so if several of those files exist, the first one will be
    returned. If none of the given files are found, undef is returned.

    The result is memoized, so repeated calls to the function with the same
    list of filenames will return the result of the first call for that
    filename.

    This function is exported automatically.

  find_containing_dir_upwards
    Like "file_find_upwards()", but reports the directory that contains one
    of the given filenames. A "Path::Class::Dir" object is returned.

    This function is exported automatically.
